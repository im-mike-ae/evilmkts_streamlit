# Winter Coalition Market Stats Viewer - User Guide

## Introduction
The Winter Coalition Market Stats Viewer is a Streamlit application that provides near real-time market data analysis for EVE Online items, specifically for the Winter Coalition. This tool helps monitor market conditions, track prices, analyze inventory levels, and monitor markey availability of doctrine ship fittings. For Chrome users, you can run it on your local machine as a standalone app by clicking on the install stramlet icon. 

**App** URL: https://wcmkts.streamlit.app/

**Support:** This app was developed by Orthel Toralen, who only vaguely knows what he's doing. For support, or to report bugs, please visit my development Discord, OrthelsLab: https://discord.gg/87Tb7YP5 

**How to Contribute:** WCMkts is an open source project written in Python 3.12 and provided under the MIT License. The source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/OrthelT/wcmkts_new Contributions to this project are very welcome. 

**NOTE:** Note, this app was designed to be used in dark mode. Use the "hamburger" menu in the upper right-hand corner to select Settings -> "Choose app theme, colors and fonts" -> "dark."

**Update Frequency:** While not fully real time, data is refreshed every three hours, with full market history updated each day around 1300 Eve time. This allows for very fast performance, because we handle calls to the Eve ESI and data processing elsewhere. The app uses just a local sqlite database that syncs periodically with a remote master database to generate data displays. Hit the "Sync Now" button on the market stats page to update the app with the most recent data.

## Database Synchronization

The application automatically syncs with the remote EVE Online market database beginning with a full refresh of market orders and history daily at 13:00 UTC and updates market orders every three hours throughout the day. You can also trigger a manual sync using the "Sync Now" button in the sidebar. If new data is available, it will update in the app. 

**Sync Status Indicators:**
- Last ESI Update: Shows when market data was last updated from ESI
- Last Sync: Shows when the local database was last synchronized with the remote database
- Next Scheduled Sync: Shows when the next automatic sync will occur
- Status: Indicates success or failure of the most recent sync

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Market Analysis
- Check the "Days Remaining" metric to identify items that need immediate attention
- Use the price history chart to identify trends and price fluctuations
- Compare market stock with "Fits on Market" to understand if stock levels are adequate

### For Doctrine Management
- Focus on ships marked as "Critical" on the Doctrine Status page
- Pay attention to the "Low Stock Modules" section to identify bottlenecks
- Use the export feature to create shopping lists for restocking

### Performance Tips
- This app was built with performance in mind. It uses Turso Cloud's embedded replica functionality to allow the performance of a locally embedded SQLite database in a production environment, using libSQL, an extremely performant fork of SQLite written in Rust. 
- The application caches data to improve performance
- Database syncs are scheduled to minimize disruption and general take just a couple seconds to complete
- Large data queries are processed in batches to prevent timeouts

## Troubleshooting

- If it is not working properly, it's probably because your humble developer managed to break something. Please feel free to send me a DM on Discord and I will try to address the issue. Discord: orthel_toralen
